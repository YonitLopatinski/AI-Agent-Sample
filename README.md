# AI-Agent-Sample

This repository ws created for my session in DDOS & Microsoft meetup "A Ticket to GenAI World".    
In this session I've introduced basic term in GenAI, and built an AI Agent using models hosted in Groq.
You can find here relevant information and basic code samples of AI Agent with tools.


## Before getting started with the code, I recommend reading my blogs:
